## Overview
This lesson continues the basics of JavaScript with arrays and loops.


## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Use arrays and loops in JavaScript to manage collections of data.
- Invoke array methods to manipulate the contents
of an array.
- Distinguish between for loops and while loops.

## Duration
180 minutes.

## Suggested Agenda

| Time | Activity | Purpose / Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00 - 0:45 | Arrays and Array Methods Reference | Show how arrays are defined and operate in JS. |
| 0:45 - 1:15 | Interactive Fruit Basket Walk-Through | Shows how arrays can be used to manage collections of data that are displayed on the screen. Also shows jQuery as an alternative form of DOM manipulation. |
| 1:15 - 1:30 | Break | |
| 1:30 - 2:15 | Loops | Introduce and compare for loops versus while loops |
| 2:15 - 3:00 | Demo/Code Challenges With Loops and Functions | At this point, you should be able to give students code challenges in JavaScript to practice what they've learned so far. Things like "find the maximum number in an array" are good challenges at this stage. |
