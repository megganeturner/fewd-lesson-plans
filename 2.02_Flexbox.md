## Suggested Agenda

| Time | Activity | Purpose / Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00 - 0:15 | Float Demo | Demonstrate the use of floats in CSS. Remind students that this isn't something they should learn, merely be aware of. "This is the old way". Works okay for images, but there are better, more modern ways to lay things out now |
| 0:15 - 1:10 | Flexbox Walkthrough | Demonstrate flexbox properties using the walk-through code as examples. |
| 1:10 - 1:20 | Partner Exercise: Nav with flexbox | Apply the flexbox parent and child rules to create a navbar. Encourage students to look at the examples from the walk-through if they get stuck â€” it will be tough going from a length, list-based explanation to actually applying the rules. |
| 1:20 - 1:35 | Break | -- |
| 1:35 - 2:00 | Children Properties & Nested Flexbox | Introduce properties applicable to specific children elements in flexbox containers. Also introducing the concept of nesting flex items |
| 2:00 - 2:50 | Airbnb Mockup | Students get a lengthier challenge based on a real-life website from a modern, techy company. Do this exercise in text editor, not atom |
| 2:50 - 3:00  | Wrap up | Wrap up the learning and share next steps. Assign homework task |
