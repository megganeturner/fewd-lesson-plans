## Differentiation and Extensions
- If there is time at the end of the lesson or if students are needing an extension, look at creating HTML tables

## Lesson Procedure

### Press Release (~20 minutes)


### Kasserole (25 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- Introduce this by talking about pair programming
    - Suggest a navigator/driver approach
    - One person sharing their screen & typing, the other person talking them through it
- Give the students 20 minutes to work together & then come back together and ask for some demos.

#### Talking Points:
- The solution has some styles applied, but please don't worry about these yet! We'll come back to this activity in another lesson (will we? check this)
- Discuss the challenges & benefits of working with someone else!
    - Acknowledge that it can be tricky to find a rhythm when coding with someone else, but it's really good to practice and bounce ideas off one another

### Cookie Time (30 minutes)
