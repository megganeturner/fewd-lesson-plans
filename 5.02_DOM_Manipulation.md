## Overview
This lesson introduces the role of JavaScript in altering, creating, and removing page elements using DOM manipulation.


## Learning Objectives

## Suggested Agenda

| Time | Activity | Purpose / Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00 - 0:20 | What is JS? | Get students thinking about how JS fits into the bigger picture. Set the stage for DOM manipulation as JS’ superpower. |
| 0:20 - 1:15 | DOM Getters/Setters and Walk-Through | Introduce DOM properties and methods. Demonstrate with the codepen or even in browser console how these work. Emphasize the pattern of *getting* a DOM object then using methods/properties to *set* new properties on them. |
| 1:15 - 1:30 | Break | n/a |
| 1:30 - 2:00 | Event Listeners Walk-Through | This should reveal why functions are so important — setting up repeatable processes that the user can trigger on demand. |
| 2:00 - 2:30 | Color Switcher | Practice in pairs with the new techniques. Be very active in supporting students through this first DOM experience. |
| 2:30 - 2:55 | Traffic Light | Independent practice with DOM events. This will be difficult for students, so frame it accordingly. |
| 2:55 - 3:00 | Wrap up | Summary & wrap up |
